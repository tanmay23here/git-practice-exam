## Branching Workflow

### Main Branch
Initial project setup and final merged code.

### Feature-A
- Created `index.html`
- Added sample HTML content
- Created Pull Request
- Merged into `main`

### Feature-B
- Modified the same lines in `index.html`
- Created Pull Request
- Generated merge conflict after Feature-A merge
- Conflict resolved manually
- Successfully merged into `main`

---

## Merge Conflict Resolution

A merge conflict occurred while merging **feature-B** because both feature branches modified the same section of the `index.html` file.

### Resolution Steps
1. Pulled latest changes from `main`
2. Identified conflict markers
3. Manually merged required code
4. Removed conflict markers
5. Committed resolved code
6. Pushed updated branch
7. Successfully merged Pull Request

---

## Fork and Contribution

A public GitHub repository was forked to demonstrate contribution workflow.

Steps performed:

- Forked repository
- Cloned fork locally
- Updated README file
- Committed changes
- Pushed changes to fork
- Created Pull Request

---

## GitLab Repository Structure

```text
project/
├── src/
│   └── app.py
├── docs/
│   └── guide.md
└── README.md
```

Repository was created as a private GitLab repository and pushed using SSH authentication.

---

## Repository Mirroring

Repository mirroring was configured between GitLab and GitHub.

### Verification
- Changes pushed to GitLab
- Automatic synchronization triggered
- Updates successfully reflected in GitHub repository

---

## Branch Protection Rules

The `main` branch is protected with the following rules:

- Direct pushes disabled
- Changes allowed only through Pull Requests
- Merge approval workflow enforced
- Repository integrity maintained
